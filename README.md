# Korean Intent Classification Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on annotating Korean sentences for Intent Classification using Label Studio. The goal is to create structured and high-quality labeled data for NLP model training and data annotation practice.

## Objectives
- Classify Korean sentences based on user intent
- Build annotation experience using professional annotation tools
- Create a consistent and structured dataset
- Develop annotation guidelines to ensure labeling quality

## Intent Categories
The dataset includes the following intent types:

- Information Inquiry
- Request Action
- Complaint
- Technical Issue
- Greeting
- Other

## Annotation Tool
Label Studio (HumanSignal)
